        "question": "Why hire a web developer instead of using Wix or Canva?",
        "answer": "Platforms like Wix or Canva are convenient for getting started, but they have significant limitations:\n\n**Performance**: A custom site loads in under 1 second, compared to 3-5 seconds on these platforms. Google penalizes slow sites in search rankings.\n\n**Ownership**: With Wix, you're renting your web presence. If you stop paying or the platform closes, everything disappears. With a developed site, you own your code.\n\n**Customization**: Templates are recognizable. Your site looks like thousands of others. A custom site truly reflects your unique identity.\n\n**SEO**: Code generated by these platforms is often poorly optimized for search engines.\n\n**Long-term cost**: Wix Pro costs ~€180/year with limited features. Our maintenance plans (€300/year) include more services and a truly performant site."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does \"eco-designed website\" mean?",
        "answer": "An eco-designed website minimizes its environmental impact at multiple levels:\n\n**Green hosting**: Our sites are hosted on Hetzner servers in Germany, powered 100% by renewable energy.\n\n**Optimized code**: Lightweight code = less data transferred = less energy consumed. Each visit to an optimized site emits ~0.2g of CO2, compared to 1-2g for a standard site.\n\n**Smart images**: Automatic compression, modern formats (WebP), lazy loading. Your images stay beautiful but weigh 5x less.\n\n**No bloat**: We avoid unnecessary trackers, resource-heavy animations, and unused features.\n\n**Durability**: A well-built site lasts for years without becoming obsolete.\n\nThe web represents 4% of global CO2 emissions. Every eco-designed site is a small action that matters."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much control will I have over my site after creation?",
        "answer": "You keep full control over the essentials:\n\n**What you can modify freely:**\n• Text and content on all pages\n• Images and photos (via a simple interface)\n• Blog posts or news\n• Products in your shop (if applicable)\n• Contact info, hours, etc.\n\n**What requires technical intervention:**\n• Adding new pages or sections\n• Changes to structure or design\n• New features\n\n**Training included**: Every delivery includes training to master your admin interface.\n\n**Responsive support**: Need a modification? Our maintenance plans include modification hours (1h to 6h/year depending on the plan).\n\nThe goal: you're autonomous for daily tasks, supported for everything else."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are your prices more affordable than the market?",
        "answer": "Our prices (€300 to €750) are 3 to 5 times cheaper than a traditional agency. Here's how it's possible:\n\n**AI as a partner**: I use Claude (Anthropic's AI) as a development assistant. This cuts my work time in half, without compromising quality – quite the opposite.\n\n**Optimized infrastructure**: A single server hosts all client sites (~€12/month for me, no per-site cost).\n\n**No unnecessary expenses**: No office, no sales team, no paid advertising. Just word-of-mouth and quality work.\n\n**A philosophy**: I believe digital shouldn't cost months of fundraising. Positive change makers – artists, therapists, associations – deserve a web presence worthy of their mission.\n\n**My skills**: 5+ years of web development experience, specialized in modern technologies (Next.js, TypeScript). Speed also comes from expertise.\n\nThis isn't low-cost, it's fair pricing."

        "question": "What are the delivery times?",
        "answer": "We deliver fast without cutting corners:\n\n**Essential Presence** (5 pages): 5-7 days\n**Engagement Pack** (+ calendar, newsletter): 7-10 days\n**Creator Pack** (+ blog, e-shop): 10-14 days\n\n**How is this possible?**\n• Clear brief from the start (structured form)\n• Modern tools and AI = accelerated development\n• Refined process and reusable templates\n• Smooth communication with you\n\n**What can extend timelines:**\n• Waiting for content (text, photos)\n• Multiple rounds of revisions\n• Adding features mid-project\n\n💡 *Tip*: Prepare your text and visuals before kickoff for a lightning-fast launch!"

      {
        "question": "Will my site rank well on Google?",

We deliver a technically perfect site – it's up to you to feed it with quality content!"

      },

        "question": "How does a project with you work?",

Proposal** (within 48h)\nDetailed quote, suggested art direction, timeline.\n\n**3. Validation & deposit**\n50% upon signing to get started.\n\n**4. Creation** (5-14 days depending on plan)\nRegular checkpoints, you validate key milestones.\n\n**5. Delivery & training**\nGo live, usage training, documentation.\nRemaining 50% upon delivery.\n\n**6. Follow-up** (optional)\nOngoing maintenance and support.\n\nNo surprises, no jargon. We move forward together."

        "question": "Do you only work with engaged actors?",

The dialogue is smoother, the result more accurate.\n\n**But also:**\nIf your project aligns with values of respect (for people, the environment, living things), let's talk! We remain open to meaningful connections.\n\nWhat we avoid: projects that contradict our values (greenwashing, polluting industries, etc.)."
